I Enjoyed The Game A Lot More, To The Point Where I Was The One Pushing Us To Do The Dlc Together, But It Still Didn'T Quite Enamour Me Like I'D Wanted It To. My Main Complaint At The Time Was The Design Of Some Of The Bosses. I Felt That A Lot Of Them Relied On Being Able To Pay Attention To Cues And Bullets Coming From Multiple Parts Of The Screen, Often With Them All Acting Completely Independently. I Have A Huge Amount Of Trouble Processing All Of That Information, So Oftentimes I Found Bosses Just Far Too Overwhelming.

Don\'T Just Shut Off The Lights--Shut Off The Lights, Plant C4 On The Power Source, And Then Blow Up The Guy Who Comes By To Turn The Lights On.  But Be Careful, Because The Enemies Will React To Anything You Do. Keep Turning The Lights Off And They Will Start Wearing Night-Vision Goggles.\N                     \N                     The Amount Of Things You Can Do In This Game Is Amazing. Even Though The Game Is Relatively Difficult (For Me, Anyway), It Always Feels Fair. It\'S Always Clear What Killed Me, And Successfully Completing A Mission Is Less A Matter Of Just Getting Better At Doing A Specific Thing And More A Matter Of Changing Tactics. Enemy Behavior Is Some Of The Most Realistic And Immersive I\'Ve Seen In A Stealth Game. Sure, You Can Cheese The Ai, But You Really Have To Work For It, Instead Of Just Going Round The Corner So The Enemies Forget Your Presence. It Really Does Feel Like Living Through An Awesome Action Movie Rather Than Playing A Video Game.\N                     \N                     I Only Have A Few Complaints. One Is That The Open World Really Is Empty; There\'S Nothing Besides Enemy Bases. I Wouldn\'T So Much Call This An Open World Game As An Open Arena Game Or A Semi-Sandbox Game Or Something Equally Clunky.  The Goal Of The Open World In This Game Is Not So Much To Simulate A Living, Breathing World (Like Skyrim Or Far Cry 4), But To Give You A Large Area Of Operations For Your Missions. It Succeeds In That Regard, But I Do Wish There Had Been Some More Dynamic Events Happening. My Other Complaint Is With The Base Management Portion Of The Game--It Feels Like A Mobile Game, And Takes Away From The Action. I Want To Be Sneaking Around And Shooting Stuff, Not Clicking Through A Menu.\N                     \N                     These Are Small Complaints, However, And I Can Safely Say That This Game Is One Of The Best Games I Have Ever Played. Since The Game Regularly Goes On Sale For A Steep Discount, I Heartily Recommend Buying It.\N                     \N                     One More Thing: You Can Put Your Own Music Into The Game To Play Through Your Pokedex Or On The Helicopter.

At The Heart Of A Great Stealth Game Is Nail-Biting Tension And Suspense. Vulnerability Is Stressed Through Risk Outweighing Reward. On A Keyboard, All Of Your Inputs Are Static. Are You Pressing Up? Good, You\'Re Moving Up. Jolting An Analog Stick Up Can Mean The Difference Between Shuffling Silently And Bringing In Nearby Ears For Inspection.

The Levels Contain Hazards In The Form Of Robots (""Badniks"" In The Western Game Manuals) In Which Dr. Robotnik Has Trapped Animals. Although Destroying A Robot Frees The Animal Within, This Is Not Required To Complete The Game. The Player Must Avoid Rows Of Sharp Spikes, Falling Into Bottomless Pits, Being Crushed By Moving Walls Or Platforms, And Drowning (Which Can Be Avoided By Breathing Air Bubbles Periodically Released From Vents). Sonic'S Main Attack Is His Spin, Where He Curls Into A Ball And Rotates Rapidly (Damaging Enemies And Some Obstacles). This Can Be Performed By Jumping In The Air Or Rolling On The Ground.
             

              Scattered Around Each Level Map Are Gold Rings And Collecting 100 Rings Rewards The Player With An Extra Life. Rings Are A Layer Of Protection Against Hazards; If Sonic Has At Least One Ring When He Collides With An Enemy, He Will Survive. However, All His Rings Will Be Scattered; They Will Flicker And Disappear In A Few Seconds If They Are Not Picked Up Again. If Sonic Is Hit Without Any Rings, He Loses A Life. Although Shields And Temporary Invincibility May Be Collected To Provide Additional Protection, Certain Hazards (Such As Drowning, Being Crushed, Falling Down A Bottomless Pit Or Running Out Of Time) Will Cost Sonic A Life Regardless Of Rings Or Other Protection.
             

              The Game Is Divided Into Six Zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, And Scrap Brain), Each With Its Own Visual Style And Enemies. A Player Must Navigate Through Each Zone (Subdivided Into Three Acts) To Progress.
             

              At The End Of Each Zone'S Third Act, The Player Confronts Dr. Robotnik (Who Pilots A Different Vehicle Each Time) In A Boss Fight. After The Sixth Zone, The Player Continues Directly To The Final Zone For A Last Encounter With Robotnik. They Begin With Three Lives (Power-Ups And Rings Add More), Which Are Lost When Sonic Collides With Hazardous Enemies (Or Objects) Without Rings, Falls Off-Screen Or Exceeds An Act'S Ten-Minute Time Limit. Lampposts Acting As Checkpoints Allow Sonic To Return To The Most-Recently Activated Post When He Loses A Life. If He Loses A Life As A Result Of Time Running Out But Has Another Life, The Timer Will Reset To 0:00 When He Returns To The Checkpoint. If All Lives Are Lost At Any Point In The Game, The Game Over Screen Will Appear (When The Player Can Return To The Beginning Of The Act With Three Lives, If They Have Any Continues).
             

              When Sonic Reaches The End Of Act One Or Act Two Of A Zone With At Least Fifty Rings, A Large Ring Appears Through Which He Can Jump To Enter A Special Stage (A ""Secret Zone"" In The Original Genesis Manual). In Each Of Six Special Stages, Sonic Bounces Off The Bumpers And Walls Of A Rotating Maze In Spin Attack. Although The Player Earns A Continue With Each 50 Rings Found, Their Main Goal Is To Obtain The Chaos Emerald At The End Of The Maze Without Colliding With A ""Goal Block"" (Which Ends The Level).","['Recomendado, Pero Tener En Cuenta Que Es La 1Era Entrega.

The Reason Can’T Be Because These Games Are Locked In An Archival Vault, For They Are Commonly Ported To Modern Platforms. It Must Be Due To The Prevailing Notion That Video Games Have An Arbitrary Expiration Date. C’Mon, Fess Up. I’M Not Saying Everyone Born After The Early 90S Shares These Predilections, But There Seems To Be A Widespread Viewpoint Among Younger Gamers That Vilifies Games That Predate Their Own Conception, Especially Those Of The Early Pixelated 2D Period Released Before The Late 1990S. A Sneering Distaste For The Classics Isn’T As Pervasive With Films Or Music. Zoomers Will Attend Theater Screenings Of 2001: A Space Odyssey High As A Kite And Emphatically Detail Their “Transcendental Experience” To Their Peers With A Pulp Fiction Poster In The Background Of Their Dorm Rooms. No One Is Delusional Enough To Place The Prequels Or Disney Star Wars Films Over The Immortal Original Trilogy Regardless Of Their Age. Maybe It’S Because I Spend Too Much Time On The Internet, But I’Ve Noticed That Discovering Older Music Artists Via The World Wide Web Is A More Common Practice Among Teenagers Now Than It Was When I Was In High School. Older Video Games, On The Other Hand, Are Treated With The Same Reaction Of Revulsion As If They Were Being Forced To Eat Their Brussels Sprouts. Admittedly, As Someone Born In The Early 3D Era, Many Of The Industry Practices And Comparatively Primitive Facets Of Game Design Can Verge On Being Excruciating. I Can Count Merely A Handful Of Games That Were Released Before I Was Born That Are Among My Personal Favorites, As There Is Only So Much Pain I Can Handle Before My Spirit Shatters And I Am In Dire Need Of A Relaxing Bath With Some Chocolate Ice Cream For Comfort. Conversely, There Are Plenty Of Those Whose Gaming Prime Was This Jagged Era, And The Shift To 3D Left Them Bewildered. They’Ve Assigned Themselves To The Role Of Gaming Elder Statesmen, Whose Repertoire Is Cryogenically Frozen To The Time Before The Medium Became Polygonal. After A Certain Point Where The Gaming Industry Reached A Point Of Proficiency With 3D Visuals To An Almost Cinematic Extent, Games That Resembled Those Of The Primeval Pixelated Years Started Popping Out Of The Indie Woodwork. One Of The First Breakout Titles In This New Wave Of Old-School Revival Games Was Shovel Knight, A 2D Side Scroller That Arguably Bridged The Generational Gap Of Gamers.']",8500,135,1900,1200,2014

              The Game Takes Place In The 60-Year Gap Between The Events Of Tolkien'S The Hobbit And The Lord Of The Rings. It Is A Story Of Revenge, Slaughter, And Mystery Set Entirely In Mordor, The Land Of Shadows. At Its Center Is Talion, An Ordinary Man Who Loses Everything, Including His Mortal Life.
             

              The Game Is Set In A Fully Open World, And Features Various Role-Playing Game Elements Such As Experience Points And Skills.

Aside From The Main Storyline, There Are Various Side Quests And Random Events The Player Can Complete Within Mordor.

The Evil Within Meanwhile Actually Managed It, But Had To Alienate Players In Some Key Ways In Order To Do So.

Then, The Mechanical Restrictions Feel Like They’Re Equally Arbitrary: Sebastian Can Only Initially Carry About Twelve Bullets, And Not Even A Full Healthbar’S Worth Of Recovery.

The Shallow Capacity For Supplies Is An Obvious Form Of Disempowerment Which Prompts Players To Spend Resources Cleverly, But Their Abundance Between Each Fight Empowers Players To Use Their Entire Toolkit Freely. The Upgrade System Empowers; The Below-Par Baselines Make Unupgraded Stats More Of A Problem In The Face Of Scaling Challenge.

              Perhaps The Most Noticeable Change From Tekken 2 Fight System Is Movement Reform - Whereas The Element Of Depth Had Been Largely Insignificant In Previous Tekken Games (Aside From Some Characters Having Unique Sidesteps And Dodging Maneuvers), Tekken 3 Added Emphasis On The Third Axis, Allowing All Characters To Sidestep In Or Out Of The Background By Lightly Pressing The Arcade Stick (Or Tapping The Controller Button In The Console Version) Towards The Corresponding Direction. Another Big Change In Movement Was That Jumping Was Toned Down, No Longer Allowing Fighters To Jump To Extreme Heights (As Was Present In Previous Games), But Keeping Leaps To Reasonable, Realistic Heights. It Made Air Combat More Controllable, And Put More Use To Sidestep Dodges, As Jumping No Longer Became A Universal Dodge Move That Was Flying Above All Of The Ground Moves. Other Than That, The Improved Engine Allowed For Quick Recoveries From Knock-Downs, More Escapes From Tackles And Stuns, Better Juggling (As Many Old Moves Had Changed Parameters, Allowing Them To Connect In Combo-Situations, Where They Wouldn'T Connect In Previous Games) And Extra Newly Created Combo Throws.
             

              Tekken 3 Was The First Tekken To Feature A Beat 'Em Up Minigame Called ""Tekken Force"", Which Pitted The Player In Various Stages Against Enemies In A Side-Scrolling Fashion. If The Player Succeeds In Beating The Minigame Four Times, Dr. Bosconovitch Would Be A Playable Character (Granted That You Defeat Him First). This Was Continued In Tekken 4 And Succeeded By The Devil Within Minigame In Tekken 5 - But Boskonovitch Was Dropped As A Playable Character After Tekken 3. There Is Also A Minigame ""Tekken Ball"", Similar To Beach Volleyball, Where One Has To Hit The Ball With A Powerful Attack To Hurt The Opponent Or Try To Hit The Ball In Such A Way That It Hits The Ground In The Opponent'S Area, Thus Causing Damage.","['Deserves The Praises That It Gets.

But As You Learn The Mechanics Of The Game And Gain Strong Units, A Hope Slowly Rises, And You Go From ""How The Hell Am I Going To Survive From This?"" To ""Hey, I Can Actually Do This!"" And You Start To Command Larger Armies On Bigger Maps. And Then, You Are Facing With The Strongest Forces Of The Empire. It\'S Actually Even Harder Then Before, But You Have So Much More Experince With The Game,You Don\'T Feel As Powerless As Before.

You Have Defense, Escape, Fog Of War(Which Isn\'T That Bad In My Opinion) And Of Course Normal Seize Missions.

This Is Obviously No Coincidence, Leif Represents The Player, But Unlike Most Games That Have A Main Character Which Is""Representing The Player""Leif Isn\'T A Silent Protagonist, His Development From An Inexperienced Kid To A Mature War Commander Is Very Natural, And Paralells Brilliantly With The Development Of You As A Player, As You Understand How The Game Works And Start Using The Tools You Have In The Most Optimal Ways.

It Was Originally Scheduled To Be Released On The Playstation 3 And Feature Playstation Move Support, But In August 2014, The Game Was Reintroduced As A Playstation 4 Exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn Is Designed To Be Played Multiple Times, As Players Will Miss Out On Quite A Bit Of Content With A Single Playthrough. Each Will Last About Nine Hours In Length And The Game Mechanics Utilize A New In-Game System Called The ""Butterfly Effect"" In Which Any Choice Of Action By The Player May Cause Unforeseen Consequences Later On. For Example, Locating A Weapon In An Earlier Chapter May Allow The Player To Pick It Up Down The Line When A Chase Scene Leads Back To The Same Room. Throughout The Game, Players Will Make Difficult Decisions During Ethical Or Moral Dilemmas, Such As Sacrificing One Character To Save Another. The Butterfly Effect System Blurs The Line Between Right And Wrong Decisions And It Is Possible For Players To Keep All Eight Characters Alive As Well As Having All Eight Of Them Die, Allowing For Many Different Paths And Scenarios As Well As Offering Several Different Endings. Until Dawn Has A Strict Auto-Save System To Prevent Players From Reloading A Previous Save File To An Earlier Point In The Game If They Regret An In-Game Decision They Have Made. The Only Way To Change The Player'S Choice Is To Restart The Game From The Beginning Or Continue To The End And Start A New Game. In A Developer Interview, It Has Been Said That Until Dawn Has ""Hundreds Of Endings"". Different Endings Have Different Variations Depending On The Combination Of Characters Alive At The End Of The Game.
             

              The Gameplay Is Focused On Exploration, Quick-Time Events And Discovering Clues As Well As Making Decisions. There Is An In-Game System That Will Keep Track Of All Of The Clues And Secrets Players Have Discovered In Total, Even If There Are Multiple Playthroughs; These Clues Will Allow The Player To Piece Together The Mysteries Of Blackwood. In Terms Of The Gameplay Mechanics And Theme, Until Dawn Has Been Noted To Be Similar To Heavy Rain And Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn Was Met With A Positive Critical Response Upon Release, With Praise Directed At The Visuals, Choice Mechanic, Horror Elements, Music, Voice Acting And Gameplay Design.

              Street Fighter Ii Is Credited For Starting The Fighting Game Boom During The 1990S. Its Success Led To The Production Of Several Updated Versions, Each Offering Additional Features And Characters Over Previous Versions, As Well As Many Home Versions. Some Of The Home Versions Of The Street Fighter Ii Games Have Sold Millions Of Copies, With The Snes Port Of The First Street Fighter Ii Being Capcom'S Best-Selling Consumer Game Of All-Time As Of 2008.
             

              Street Fighter Ii Follows Several Of The Conventions And Rules Already Established By Its Original 1987 Predecessor. The Player Engages Opponents In One-On-One Close Quarter Combat In A Series Of Best-Two-Out-Of-Three Matches. The Objective Of Each Round Is To Deplete The Opponent'S Vitality Before The Timer Runs Out. If Both Opponents Knock Each Other Out At The Same Time Or The Timer Runs Out With Both Fighters Having An Equal Amount Of Vitality Left, A ""Double Ko"" Or ""Draw Game"" Is Declared And Additional Rounds Will Be Played Until Sudden Death. In The First Street Fighter Ii, A Match Could Last Up To Ten Rounds If There Was No Clear Winner; This Was Reduced To Four Rounds In Champion Edition And Onward. If There Is No Clear Winner By The End Of The Final Round, Then Either The Computer-Controlled Opponent Will Win By Default In A Single-Player Match Or Both Fighters Will Lose In A 2-Player Match.
             

              After Every Third Match In The Single Player Mode, The Player Will Participate In A ""Bonus Game"" For Additional Points. The Bonus Games Includes (In Order) A Car-Breaking Event; A Barrel Breaking Bonus Game Where The Barrels Are Dropped Off From A Conveyor Belt Above The Player; And A Drum-Breaking Bonus Game Where Drums Are Flammable And Piled Over Each Other. The Bonus Games Were Removed From The Arcade Version Of Super Street Fighter Ii Turbo.
             

              Like In The Original, The Game'S Controls Uses A Configuration Of An Eight-Directional Joystick And Six Attack Buttons. The Player Uses The Joystick To Jump, Crouch And Move The Character Towards Or Away From The Opponent, As Well As To Guard The Character From An Opponent'S Attacks. There Are Three Punch Buttons And Three Kick Buttons Of Differing Strength And Speed (Light, Medium And Heavy). The Player Can Perform A Variety Of Basic Moves In Any Position, Including Grabbing/Throwing Attacks, Which Were Not Featured In The Original Street Fighter. Like In The Original, The Player Can Perform Special Moves By Inputting A Combination Of Directional And Button-Based Commands.
             

              Street Fighter Ii Differs From The Original Due To The Selection Of Multiple Playable Characters, Each With Their Distinct Fighting Styles And Special Moves. Additionally, The Player Can Also ""Cancel"" During Animation By Performing Another Move, Allowing For A Combination Of Several Basic And Special Moves.

A Heavily Altered Port Was Produced For The Famicom/Nes (Without Kojima'S Involvement). A Remade Version Based On The Original Msx2 Game Was Released As A Bonus Game In Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence For The Playstation 2 And, As A Result, Is Also Included In Metal Gear Solid Hd Collection And Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.
             

              The Game Revolves Around A Special Forces Operative Codenamed Solid Snake Who Goes Into A Solo Infiltration Mission Into The Fortified State Of Outer Heaven To Destroy Metal Gear, A Bipedal Walking Tank Capable Of Launching Nuclear Missiles From Anywhere In The World.
             

              The Player Must Navigate The Main Character, A Military Operative Codenamed Solid Snake, Through Various Locations, While Avoiding Visual Contact And Direct Confrontation With Patrolling Guards. If The Player Is Seen, The Game Enters The ""Alert Mode."" In This Situation, Snake Must Escape From Enemy'S Sight In Order To Resume Infiltration. The Method Of Escaping Varies Depending On The Circumstances Behind Discovery:
             

              If Snake Is Seen And Only A Single Exclamation Mark Appears Over An Enemy'S Head, Only The Enemies In The Player'S Present Screen Will Attack And Snake Can Escape By Simply Moving To An Adjacent Screen.
              
              However, If Two Exclamation Marks Appear Over The Enemy (Or The Player Triggers An Alarm By Being Spotted By A Camera, Infrared Sensor Or By Using An Unsuppressed Weapon), Reinforcements From Off-Screen Will Appear As Well. Snake Can Only Escape By Eliminating All Incoming Enemies, Going Outdoors, Or By Entering An Elevator.
              
              The Player Starts The Game Unarmed, But Eventually Acquires Firearms Such As A Beretta 92F And An M79 Grenade Launcher, As Well As Explosives Such As Remote Control Missiles And Landmines. Ammo And Supplies For Weapons Are Limited, But Are Replenished By Picking Up Ammunition Caches Or Additional Supplies. Weapons Can Not Only Be Used To Kill Enemies, But Also To Clear Obstacles Such As Hollow Walls And Electrified Floors. Snake Can Also Use His Fists To Punch And Defeat Patrolling Enemies. Occasionally, If The Player Defeats A Guard With Punches Without Alerting Anyone, The Defeated Guard Will Yield A Single Unit Of Rations Or An Ammo Box That Can Be Picked Up. In Addition To Enemy Guards, The Player Will Also Be Confronted By Mercenaries Who Will Challenge The Player To Combat, Serving As The Boss Characters.
             

              The Enemy Base Consists Of Three Different Buildings, With Multiple Floors (Including Basement Levels) Within Them. The Player Uses Key Cards And Other Items To Unlock Doors And Explore New Areas. Each Door Will Only Open To Its Corresponding Key Cards. Information Can Be Obtained By Rescuing Hostages Being Held Within The Buildings. After Rescuing Five Hostages, The Player'S Rank Will Increase By One Star (With The Maximum Rank Being Four Stars), Allowing For Increased Carrying Capacity And Maximum Health. However, If A Hostage Is Killed, The Player Is Demoted To The Previous Rank.
             

              A Transceiver Is Available For The Player To Communicate With Their Commanding Officer, Big Boss, Or One Of The Resistance Members Operating Covertly Near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, And Jennifer). Each Of Snake'S Allies Specializes In A Specific Subject. The Player Must Keep Track Of Their Allies' Frequency Numbers In Order To Contact Them.

In The End, It Had A Bit Of Overworld, Two Dungeons, And A Weirdly Boring Shmup Section Before The Final Boss. (No Joking; I Played Through This Game Twice, Several Years Apart, And I Literally Dozed Off During The Mermaid Shmup Part Both Times.) Truly, This Series Just Needed A Chance To Get A New, Real, Release That Would Let It Stretch Its Psuedo-Metroidvania Wings And Be An Amazing Game!\N                     \N                     Well, We More-Or-Less Got That With Pirate\'S Curse. While The Metroidvania Aspects Were Still Very Simplistic - The World Was Broken Up Into Several Islands, Most Of Which Had Extremely Linear Maps - The New Pirate Abilities Were Much More Fun And Easy To Use Than The Old Transformations, So It Was Still Fun To Backtrack Through The Islands To Find Hidden Items. (The Series Is Closer To A Sidescrolling Zelda, Now That I Think About It, Since There Are The Dungeons That Are Separate From The Overworld And Don\'T Require A Revisit Unless You Happen To Miss Something.) At The Time, I (Among Others) Thought That They Still Needed To Make The Next Step Towards A ""Proper"" Metroidvania And They\'D Truly Have Something.\N                     \N                     Then There Was Half-Genie Hero.

We Had Only Played The Original Game And Risky\'S Revenge At This Point, And Had The Promise Of Pirate\'S Curse Releasing Within A Year Or Two. Additionally, The As-Yet-Unreleased Pirate\'S Curse Had The Best Character Art In The Series (Thanks To Inticreates Aiding With Parts Of The Game) As Well As The Best Pixel Art, Hgh Went With More Of A Chibi-Styled, Smooth Style. Still, More Shantae Was More Shantae, And It Felt Like The Series Was Finally Getting Its Due (Even If The Fans Had To Pay For Some Of The Development). Ultimately, Though, The Game Was Closer To A Mega Man X Entry Than The Earlier Games\' Metroidvania/Sidescrolling Zelda Style. There Was No Overworld With Dungeons, But Instead Several Independent Platforming Stages That You Would Select From A List. As With The Mmx Games, You Could Return To Completed Stages With New Abilities To Find More Powerups. Unlike The Mmx Games, Though, In Which You Get Both Permanent Upgrades (Helmet, Boots, Etc.) And Special Weapons You Can Easily Swap Between, Shantae Has To Stop And Do A Transformation Dance In Order To Use Her New Abilities. It Leads To A Slower, Less Fun, Platforming Experience And I Was Ultimately Disappointed In The Game.\N                     \N                     Finally, This Leads Us To Seven Sirens. We Finally Got What We Wanted, In A Monkey\'S Paw Sort Of Way. There\'S A Full, Interconnected, Metroidvania Map Now! ...But There Are Also The Zelda-Like Dungeons That Are Independent Of Each Other And The Overworld. While Some Of These Have Been Fun In Earlier Games, The Dungeons I Played In Ss Are Very Simple And Straightforward. I\'D Rather Have Just The Connected Map With More Interesting Platforming And Puzzles. Additionally, Early On You Get An Ability That Reveals Secrets, Ranging From Gems (Money) To Hidden Platforms. The Unfortunate Part Is That You Get A Visual Notification On Every Screen In Which There Is Something Hidden, Which Is Basically Almost Every Screen, Requiring You To Stop And Use The Ability To Try And Find Whatever It Is. Most Of The Time, It\'S Nothing Special, And This Power Also Uses Mana (Or Whatever), So You Need To Fill It Up After Using It Several Times.\N                     \N                     All That To Say That The Series Has Come Close To Greatness, But Never Quite Reaches It, And The Best Entry Is Now Lost In The Middle Of A Bunch Of Mediocre-At-Best Games.', ""I Debate Back And Forth Whether Or Not I Like This Or Pirate'S Curse More. I Like The Change To One Single Open Metroidvania World When Compared To The Separate Segmented Ones Of The Past. The Way Transformations Work Is Probably The Best In The Series With How Seamless And Fluid They Are, But The Dances Feel A Bit Lame. There'S So Many Different Rooms Where You Can Use Them And Most Of The Time There'S Nothing More Than Gems That You Get Out Of Them.\N                     \N                     I Found The Gameplay Balancing To Be A A Bit Out Of Wack As Well. I Played On The Definitive Mode That The Game Recommends And Found The Game Much, Much Harder At The Beginning. You Are Starved For Healing Items And Resources, Which Made The Beginning Parts A Lot More Challenging Than Anything Later.

As For Gameplay, They Finally Fixed The Transformations Problem, Even If They'Re Still Not As Good As The Pirate Gear In Pirate'S Curse It'S A Step In The Right Direction. The Game Is Great And A Lot Of Fun, But It Has Some Problems. The Bosses Are Pretty Bad, Most Of Them Consisting Of Dodging A Sequence Of Three Attacks And Then Hitting Them For A While, Rinse And Repeat, Although A Couple Of Them Are Admittedly Fun. The Animated Sequences Look Pretty Rough Too, But It'S A Noble Concept That I Hope To See Expanded In Later Games. Finally, Good God, Trying To Beat This Game With 100% Completion Is A Freaking Chore, As Most Of The Items You Need Are Hidden Or In A Location That Hasn'T Been Relevant In A While, And There Being No Markers On The Map To Remember Where They Are Is A Missed Opportunity.

It Is My Firm Belief That If You Haven\'T Watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, Or The Breakfast Club Before The Age Of 18, You Will Never Understand Or Enjoy These Things (At Least, I Did Not)*.

This Game Would Have Been Really Cool If I Had Played It When I Was 10-12 (It Was Not Out In The Mid-00S, And There Was No Way The Graphic Violence Would Have Gotten Past My Mom\'S One-Woman Censorship Board). It Would Probably Be Pretty Cool If I Was In College And Played It While Listening To Lectures Or Something.

The Combat Is In Real Time, And Feels Close To Dragon\'S Dogma Or Scarlet Nexus, If You Are Familiar With Those Games. The Combat In Amalur Has The Twin Drawbacks Of Being Barebones And Stiff. There Is Only One Basic Attack (No Light/Heavy Attacks Or Parries), A Dodge That Feels Awkward To Use, A Range Attack That Quickly Runs Out Of Ammo And Seems Quite Pointless, And A Set Of Spells That Can Be Customized. The Spells Are Kind Of Cool, But They,  Can\'T Really Be Chained Into Combos,. There Is Also A Super Saiyan Mode That Can Be Built Up By Filling Up Your Rage/Devil Triggers/Whatever; Instead Of Making You Superpowered For A Small Amount Of Time (Like Dmc) Or Giving You Access To A Massive Attack That Can Curbstomp Multiple Enemies At Once (Like Blades Of Time), It Gives You The Change To Attack One Enemy With A Super Special Attack That Gives You Extra Exp. Combat In This Game Has No Depth And Feels Like A Repetitive Chore; The Lack Of A Parry, A Decent Dodge, Or Any Combos Beyond Your Basic ""Tap X"" Sequence Is Keenly Felt. The Swift, Exciting, And Somewhat Open-Ended Combat Of Devil May Cry Has Spoiled Me, I Suppose.\N                     \N                     It Is True That There Are Some Combos That You Can Unlock In The Game, But I Didn\'T Find The Ones That I Unlocked Useful. Additionally, You Also Have To Use Perk Points To Unlock Them Only For Specific Weapons. Realize That The Hammer Sucks And Want To Use A Greatsword? Too Bad, You\'Ve Put All Of Your Points Into The Hammer. It Is True That You Can Respec Later On, But This Kind Of Game Would Have Benefitted From A Skyrim-Style System Where You Level Up Weapons Ability Based On Using The Weapon.\N                     \N                     The Story Is Your Usual High-Fantasy Bafflegarble; It\'S Not Great, But I\'M Usually Fairly Lenient On Bad Stories As Long As They Aren\'T Shoved In Your Face By ""Cinematic"" Cutscenes. The Dialogue Choices Tend To Be Pointless And Apparently You Can Use Persuasion Skills To Steamroll Past Everything. I Highly Dislike Dialogue Choices In Games Where They Do Not Make A Difference Or Make Very Little Difference; Developers And Writers Need To Have Confidence In The Story That They Are Telling.\N                     \N                     The ""Open World"" Is A Series Of Poorly-Disguised Corridors With The Occasional Boring Dungeon. The Game Feels Less Open Than An N64 Zelda, And Even The Map Clearly Shows The Corridors. Thus, There\'S No Real Exploration In The Game; Not That There Is Any Real Point To The Exploration Anyway. I Found Nothing About The Enemy Designs, World, Or Other Art To Be At All Interesting. The Semi-Cartoony Art Style Clashed With The Occasional Graphic Violence Of The Game. Every Npc Has A Thousand Dialogue Keywords That You Can Choose From, And None Of Them Are Interesting.  The Loot System Was Not Engaging Or Addicting; There Was No Way To Easily Compare Stats For New Items Vs Equipped Items, And Given The Fact That Combat Felt Like A Chore, I Didn\'T Really Feel Excited To Upgrade My Gear. I Am Barely Interested In Smithing, Crafting, Alchemy Etc.

The Game Was Developed By Neversoft And Published By Activision, And Released Internationally In September 2009 For The Xbox 360, Playstation 2, 3 And Wii Consoles. Similar To The Preceding Title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 Is Geared Towards Playing In A Four-Person Band Experience, Including Lead And Bass Guitar, Drums, And Vocals. The Game Is Available As A Standalone Title, Allowing Players To Use Existing Compatible Instrument Controllers, And As A Bundle That Provides These Controllers. Guitar Hero 5 Adds Several New Features, Such As Drop-In/Drop-Out Play, Bands Composed Of Any Combination Of Available Instruments, A Rockfest Competitive Mode Consisting Of Several Various Scoring Mechanisms, And Both Song-Specific And General Challenges To Unlock New Avatars, Clothing, And Other Extras In The Game. Many Of These Changes Were Added To Make The Game A More Social Experience, Allowing Players Across A Range Of Skill Levels To Be Able To Play Cooperatively And Competitively Against Each Other Both Locally And Online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5'S Track List Contains 85 Songs By 83 Separate Artists, And Like Previous Guitar Hero Games, Several Musicians With Works In The Game Have Been Modeled Through Motion Capture For Playable Characters In The Game, Including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, And Kurt Cobain. Players Can Also Create Their Own Character And Instrument To Play With. The Game Continues To Support The User-Created Music Studio Introduced In World Tour Through Ghtunes, And Additional Downloadable Content For The Game Was Also Made Available. A Majority Of Existing Downloadable Tracks From World Tour Are Forward-Compatible With Guitar Hero 5, Along With Selected On-Disc Tracks From World Tour And Guitar Hero Smash Hits, And Songs From The Game Could Also Be Exported For A Fee To Play In Its Sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors Of Rock, And Spin-Off Game Band Hero.
